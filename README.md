# Introduction
Converting binary code to grey code is known as binary to grey conversion. This may produce an error during the transition from one number to the next in the typical series of binary numbers generated by the device. Because only one bit changes its value during any transition between two values, the Gray code can readily solve this problem. The most common application of Grey Code is in embedded systems, notably in counting; but, as automation in everyday gadgets and technology increases, so will the use of grey code as a whole.Gray code's most common application is the encoding of data. Binary signals are used to determine a position in 1D space. Black-and-white or transparent-opaque designs are typically scanned.It could be done optically, but it could also be done with mechanical contacts in theory. A grey code is a method of encoding a set of values in which the code for n and the code for n+1 differ only by one bit position. This is a useful trait for things like shaft encoders, because even if the sensors are misaligned, you always obtain clean transitions in the readout from n to n+1 with no glitching to other codes.


## Converting from binary to grayscale:


The Binary to Gray Code Converter is a logical circuit that converts binary code into its Gray code equivalent. The n-bit grey code can be obtained by placing the MSB of 1 below the axis and the MSB of 1 above the axis, then reflecting the (n-1) bit code about an axis after 2n-1 rows.

The following is the 4-bit binary to grey code conversion table:

In 4-bit gray code, the 3-bit code is reflected against the axis drawn after the 24-1-1th =8th row.

## How to Change a Binary Code into a Gray Code


1)The MSB of a Gray code number is always the same as the first bit of the binary number.


2)To perform the second bit of the grey code, we use the exclusive-or (XOR) of the binary number's first and second bits. If both bits are different, the outcome will be one; otherwise, the result will be 0.


3)To obtain the 3rd bit of the grey code, we must conduct an exclusive-or (XOR) operation on the binary number's 2nd and 3rd bits. For the 4th bit of the Gray code, the procedure is the same. To further comprehend these stages, consider the following scenario.




G0=B0 xor B1,




G1=B1 xor B2

G2=G2 xor G3

G3=B3.
