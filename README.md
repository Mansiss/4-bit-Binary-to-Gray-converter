Introduction: Binary to Gray conversion is used to convert binary code to its equivalent gray code. In the normal sequence of binary numbers generated by the hardware that may cause an error during the transition from one number to the next. So, the Gray code can eliminate this problem easilysince only one bit changes its value during any transition
between two numbers. The most dominating application of Grey Code is in embedded system itself and specifically in counting, with increase in automation in day to day gadgets
and tech the application of gray code will increase as a whole.


Binary to Gray code conversion
The Binary to Gray code converter is a logical circuit that is used to convert the binary code into its equivalent Gray code. By putting the MSB of 1 below the axis and the MSB of 1 above the axis and reflecting the (n-1) bit code about an axis after 2n-1 rows, we can obtain the n-bit gray code.

The 4-bit binary to gray code conversion table is as follows:

Decimal Number	4-bit Binary Code	4-bit Gray Code:

In 4-bit gray code, the 3-bit code is reflected against the axis drawn after the 24-1-1th =8th row.

How to Convert Binary to Gray Code


1)In the Gray code, the MSB will always be the same as the 1'st bit of the given binary number.


2)In order to perform the 2nd bit of the gray code, we perform the exclusive-or (XOR) of the 1'st and 2nd bit of the binary number. It means that if both the bits are different, the result will be one else the result will be 0.


3)In order to get the 3rd bit of the gray code, we need to perform the exclusive-or (XOR) of the 2nd and 3rd bit of the binary number. The process remains the same for the 4th bit of the Gray code. Let's take an example to understand these steps.
